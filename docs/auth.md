# Authentication

RapidSpike’s API uses **HMAC-signed authentication** to ensure requests are secure and time-bound.

Each user has two keys:
- **Public key** — acts as your API identity.
- **Private key** — used to sign the request. Never share or transmit this key.

---

## 🔐 How Authentication Works

Every request must include:
- The current Unix timestamp (`time`)
- Your public key (`public_key`)
- An HMAC signature (`signature`)

The signature is generated by hashing your public key and timestamp with your private key:

```php
<?php
$time = time();
$package = $public_key . "\n" . $time;
$bin_signature = hash_hmac('sha1', $package, $private_key, true);
$uri_signature = base64_encode($bin_signature);

echo http_build_query([
    'time' => $time,
    'public_key' => $public_key,
    'signature' => $uri_signature,
]);
